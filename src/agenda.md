AI Kata Camp - Complete Agenda
Sessions Overview
Workflow automation with LLMs and n8n
Speaker: Paweł Andziak

Description: In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to combine the power of n8n, a no-code/low-code automation platform, with LLMs to streamline everyday tasks and improve productivity. We'll explore practical, real-world automation scenarios by building AI-assisted workflows that eliminate repetitive manual work.

Bio: Engineering Leader and hands-on AI product builder with experience in US and UK-based tech startups.

Requirements: n8n.io account (at least trial), API key to any LLM (preferably OpenAI)

Implementing features with Cursor IDE
Speaker: Ivan Lapa (Netflix)

Description: We're going to build the blog posting feature with UI and backend together, getting familiar with Cursor features like planning mode, built-in browser, Figma + GitHub MPC servers.

Bio: Ivan is an engineer with more than 11 years of experience building enterprise software and ML powered applications. He has led teams and delivered practical ML features for both enterprise products and unicorn startups. His work focuses on modern UI applications, API services, and integrating AI tools into engineering workflows.

Requirements: Cursor IDE with at least trial version

Code with Claude: Practical AI Development Workshop
Speaker: Tomasz Gancarczyk

Description: Learn to code faster and smarter with Claude Code CLI. This hands-on workshop teaches essential AI-assisted development workflows through progressive coding challenges. Master effective prompting, iterative refinement, code navigation, and debugging with AI. Discover the mindset shift from "writing every line" to "directing an AI coding partner." Bring your laptop, leave with practical skills. All experience levels welcome.

Bio: Independent AI consultant and early adopter. He's built various AI projects - from enterprise automation to developer training. Works with several companies on AI strategy and development, specializing in practical workflows that actually ship. Likes to talk to Claude! Based in Warsaw.

Requirements: Claude Pro subscription

Code Refactoring in Cursor
Speaker: Matt Kutyba

Description: Transform messy, legacy code into clean, maintainable software using Cursor IDE's AI capabilities. You'll learn practical techniques for AI-assisted refactoring of the messy project, that you can apply immediately in your daily work. (.NET C#)

Bio: AI consultant, CTO, software dev.

Requirements: Cursor IDE with at least trial version, .NET 10 SDK

Rapid AI product delivery - from prototype to production
Speaker: Maksymilian Majer

Description: New tech companies need builders at every level. I will show you how to use Lovable.dev to collaboratively design products with your stakeholders (PMs, colleagues, and end users) and turn them into production-ready code.

Bio: Maks is a founder (post-exit) and software engineer with 20+ years of experience. He built products for startups and enterprises. As a Principal Engineer at Nursa, he leads AI adoption in product development across the entire engineering and product team.

Requirements: Claude Code Pro subscription, free Lovable.dev account

Spec-Driven Development: Building Better AI Agent Instructions
Speaker: Scott Frasso

Description: Learn how to prevent AI coding agents from derailing by creating clear, codebase-aware specifications. We'll start by manually crafting an AGENTS.md file to understand what makes AI agents work effectively, then introduce Shotgun CLI—a tool that automates this process by indexing your codebase and generating specs that keep Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf on track. You'll leave with practical skills for directing AI agents and a tool that turns your intent into buildable specifications.

Bio: Scott is a Senior Software Engineer with 20 years of experience, currently at Proofs where he rebuilt their entire product in 30 days using Claude Code (which wrote 90%+ of the code) and achieved their first paying customer within 14 hours of launch. He created Shotgun CLI, an open-source tool for spec-driven development that helps developers write better instructions for AI coding agents.

Requirements: An AI Coding Agent (Codex, Claude Code, Windsurf). Optional: Shotgun CLI installed (https://app.shotgun.sh/) with API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini)

Task Master: specs-driven development in practice
Speaker: Łukasz Wróbel

Description: Let's build a realistic project from scratch, without any dependencies on a specific coding agent or IDE, using CLI or chatting. We begin an idea, turn it into a clearly defined source of truth. Then we create a manageable plan with interconnected tasks that evolve with changing requirements. In the meantime we will learn how to use MCP tools and manage context in large projects.

Bio: AI solution architect

Requirements: API keys to any LLM, IDE (I'll use Cursor)

Not Only Claude and Codex – How to Use a Coding Agent Under the Console for Free
Speaker: Justyna Wojtczak

Description: A practical workshop showing how to run a free agent for generating and refactoring code without the need to use paid models.

Bio: Fractional CTO at Proxi Cloud. Programmer with 15 years of experience (Ruby on Rails, database optimization). I build and automate end-to-end AI products. Privately, I develop my own generative AI projects.

Requirements: Installed opencode, favorite development environment, internet access.
