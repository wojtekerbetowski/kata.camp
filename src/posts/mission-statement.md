Kata Camp is a community series of practice-first workshops where software engineers deepen their craft through focused katas. We emphasize hands-on learning, practical techniques, and collaborative improvement.

Our mission is to make everyday software engineering better through repeated, deliberate practice guided by experts. Sessions are short, structured exercises designed to build fluency in specific skills and AI-assisted workflows.

I have been passionate about kata-style learning for years ? I organized Git Kata back in 2013; you can see the materials here: [Git Kata (2013) page source](https://github.com/wojtekerbetowski/git-kata).
