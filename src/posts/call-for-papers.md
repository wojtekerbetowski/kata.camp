> Edit (2025-11-21): The lineup is now fixed and the Call for Papers is closed.

We're opening our Call for Papers for upcoming Kata Camp sessions. If you have a practical kata, talk, or hands-on workshop that helps engineers build real skills through deliberate practice, we'd love to hear from you.

Submit your proposal using this form:

**Call for Papers**: https://forms.gle/EGEnvuFfXxSeXFQN6

What we're looking for:

- Practice-first sessions with clear, repeatable exercises
- Real-world techniques engineers can apply immediately
- Strong facilitation and feedback loops

Thank you for contributing to the community!
