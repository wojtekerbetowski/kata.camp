We're excited to share that Kata Camp is partnering with **GDG Warsaw**. We're united by a simple idea: the best way to get better at engineering is to practice the real thing - together, often, and with guidance from practitioners who do it every day.

## Why Kata Camp

Kata Camp exists to make everyday software engineering better through deliberate, repeated practice. Our katas are short, focused exercises that help engineers build fluency in core capabilities - problem framing, test-first thinking, AI-assisted workflows, and tight feedback loops. You'll leave each session with habits you can bring to work the next day.

## What you'll do in this event

- Work through a series of concise, guided katas designed for real-world impact
- Pair up and iterate quickly with expert feedback at each step
- Practice practical applications of AI tools - prompting patterns, review workflows, and automation
- Build confidence in day-to-day techniques you'll use immediately at work

Practical details: bring your laptop with Docker installed; sessions are in English; the event is non-profit; no recordings; food and coffee provided.

## Partnering with GDG Warsaw

We're grateful to **GDG Warsaw** for joining forces with us. GDG's mission - to advance the local technology community - aligns naturally with Kata Camp's practice-first approach. This partnership enables us to reach more engineers and deliver a stronger experience for everyone attending.

## Venue: Google Campus Warsaw

Thanks to this cooperation, the event will take place at **Google Campus Warsaw**. It's an ideal environment for hands-on learning and community building.

We're thankful for GDG Warsaw's support in organising and hosting this event - and we can't wait to see you there.
