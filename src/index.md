# Kata Camp

Kata Camp is a community series of practice-first workshops where software engineers deepen their craft through focused katas. We emphasize hands-on learning, practical techniques, and collaborative improvement.

Our mission is to make everyday software engineering better through repeated, deliberate practice guided by experts.

# What is a Kata?

A kata is a short, structured exercise designed to build fluency in specific skills. In our sessions you'll apply modern engineering practices and AI-assisted workflows in small, focused iterations.
